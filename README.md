# Solutions for Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach

This repository is a collection of my solutions to the assigned programming assignments for ["Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach" on Coursera.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-foundations)

The solutions require that you have Jupyter and GraphLab Create installed. To view the solutions, simply `cd` into the "weekX" directory and run `jupyter notebook`. Then open the .ipynb file in the folder and run all of the cells in the notebook. You can then interact with the data in the notebook, as well as view the python code that created the data visualizations/models.
